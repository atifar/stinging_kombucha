                    <p class="paragraph-lead-in">Why Kombucha?</p>
                    <p>I've always loved hot sauces and decided to create one of my own,
                        an unpasteurized sauce made with Kombucha instead of vinegar &#8212;
                        a probiotic sauce whose gut-friendly bacteria can improve digestion
                        and strengthen the immune system while adding zest and flavor to
                        any dish. Kombucha is naturally fermented mushroom tea with a living
                        colony of yeast and bacteria, and it has many benefits such as
                        fighting harmful yeast overgrowth; improving mental clarity and mood
                        stability; detoxification; stimulating the immune system; and
                        improving liver function and digestion. No wonder Kombucha has been
                        called the “Elixir of Life."</p>
                    <p>A shorter fermentation produces a sweeter Kombucha with a higher
                        sugar content because the mother hasn't consumed all the sugar during
                        the ferment. Longer fermentation produces a more acidic Kombucha
                        because more of the sugar has been used and more acids produced. The
                        Kombucha in my Stinging Kombucha Hot Sauce is slightly sweet and
                        faintly acidic &#8212; and still ALIVE. When mixed with the other
                        ingredients and bottled it will still be active, which is why the
                        sauce needs to be refrigerated.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph-lead-in">Description</p>
                    <p>We combined our organic kombucha with a handpicked selection of spices,
                        variations of peppers and a hint of red sauerkraut to create
                        mouth-watering hot sauce unlike anything you’ve ever tasted. We
                        perfected the flavor and thanks to many tasting trials have finally
                        arrived at culinary symmetry. Not to mention synergy.</p>
                    <p>100 percent of the ingredients in our Stinging Kombucha Hot Sauce
                        come from the finest food suppliers in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph-lead-in">Heat Level</p>
                    <p>Strangely this remains a philosophical question. We've tried to
                        come up with some kind of precise number from 1-10, (10 being
                        “the end of the World”). But with each taste trial we realized
                        that our subjects were developing resistance to the heat, hence
                        5 became 4 and so on... We therefore consider our Stinging Kombucha
                        Hot Sauce to be somewhere between 3 (“gee, that IS spicy”) and 7
                        (“are you going to drink that whole beer yourself?”) but never 10!</p>
                    <p class="paragraph-lead-in">Aim</p>
                    <p>Our Hot Sauce will tickle your tastebuds, cool you off in hot
                        weather and will raise your metabolism. The hot sensations will
                        momentarily take you through valleys of ever-changing bliss, but
                        it will not continue to burn long after consumption, nor will
                        it incur any lasting damage, physical or psychological...</p>
                    <p class="paragraph-lead-in">Use</p>
                    <p>Our hot sauce complements all types of foods, breakfast eggs,
                        flavoring your home made sauces, whisk into vinaigrette for a
                        salad, add a bit of spiciness to your burger, add to your cocktail
                        sauce, dollop on raw oysters, steaks or chicken, combine a few
                        drops with simple syrup & toss with a fruit salad, spice up your
                        tacos. Some of our customers claim, S.K. makes the tastiest
                        Bloody Mary on the planet.</p>
                    <p>Our Stinging Kombucha hot sauce will never interfere with flavor
                        of your meal and will not numb your taste buds. It does NOT
                        include vinegar, which can be often somewhat harsh and too
                        acidic. Its flavor spectrum is wide with gentle kick of spiciness.
                        Do not worry. Its burn will never linger for too long not to
                        tamper with your meal.</p>
